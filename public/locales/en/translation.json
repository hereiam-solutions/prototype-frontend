        "slow4": "check if the permissions to access the location are enabled while you are using the app (in the browser and in the operating system)",
        "slow5": "use the automatic time zone for the cell phone",
        "slow6": "make sure that the phone is not in power saving mode. If necessary, deselect battery optimization and do not use the app when the phone is charging from an empty state.",
        "short1": "Since hereIam needs access to GPS, your phone may consume more battery life while you are actively using the map and features.",
        "short2": "This often happens with apps that depend on these phone settings. If you think that our app consumes too much battery life, we recommend you to check the phone's battery settings and adjust them to the usage with the app.",
        "short3": "We try to make our app as resource efficient as possible.",
        "acc1": "We use maps and geodata material from third-party providers who keep their offer as up-to-date as possible.",
        "acc2": "But since data is constantly changing around the world, some of them may take a little longer to reflect changed data in the map.",
        "acc3": "We try to make our app as actually as possible.",
