## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

In crisis and disasters, when missing information meets missing experiences, lives are in danger. Actually there is no sufficient and effective exchange between alls actors in the field and the higher level. hereIam will provide a homogeneous solution for information sharing and decision making in crisis and disasters. For this purpose we close information gaps, provide best practices and connects all actors to make them more effective. We build hereIam as simple as working with pen and paper.

In close exchange with professionals, we have developed initial key requirements, with a focus on urban search & rescue. With this, we already achieve a high impact with the prototype for national and international operations, when it is necessary to record many injured and affected persons in a large damage area, to support the safety of the teams and to provide data for the next tasks. 

Key features of **hereIam prototype**:

- Mission planing and deployment from a distance
- marking hazards & obstacles
- visualize structure assessment (building characteristics, define sectors)
- define and update worksites (possible locations of trapped persons)
- detect and locate victims
- plan rescue tasks
- initial triage of patients (first medical assessment)
- registration of affected people

<summary>Additional info</summary>
<br>

We see the prototype as an experiment. With it, we want to validate the internal processes, the design of the interfaces and the effectiveness in use in close contact with users. We will transfer positive results into a further development path and develop them into an overall solution.

## Acknowledgements

In the process of developing hereIam prototype, we used not only our own ideas and experiences &ndash; We read many (sometimes contradictory) recommendations for disaster management tasks and examined real solutions in actual use, and tried to distill the best ideas into the result you see here.
